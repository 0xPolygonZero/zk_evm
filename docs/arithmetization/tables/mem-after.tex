\subsection{MemAfter}
\label{mem-after}

The MemBefore holds the content of the memory after the execution of the current segment. For consistency, it must be exactly the same as the MemBefore trace
of the next segment.
Each row of the MemBefore table contains:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $a$, the memory cell address,
  \item $v$, the initial value of the cell.
\end{enumerate}
The MemAfter table should be ordered by $(a, \tau)$. Since it only holds values, there are no constraints between the rows.

A CTL copies the final values from memory to this trace. For more details on which values are propagated, consult \ref{memory}.
