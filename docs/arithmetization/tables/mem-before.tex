\subsection{MemBefore}
\label{mem-before}

The MemBefore holds the content of the memory before the execution of the current segment. For consistency, it must be exactly the same as the MemAfter trace
of the previous segment.
Each row of the MemBefore table contains:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $a$, the memory cell address,
  \item $v$, the initial value of the cell.
\end{enumerate}
The MemBefore table should be ordered by $(a, \tau)$. Since it only holds values, there are no constraints between the rows.

A CTL copies all of these initial values in the memory trace as reads, at timestamp $\tau = 0$.
