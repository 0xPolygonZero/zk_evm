\subsection{Memory continuations}
\label{mem-continuations}

The MemBefore (resp. MemAfter) table holds the content of the memory before (resp. after) the execution of the current segment.
For consistency, the MemAfter trace of a segment must be identical to the MemAfter trace of the next segment.
Each row of these tables contains:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $a$, the memory cell address,
  \item $v$, the initial value of the cell.
\end{enumerate}
The tables should be ordered by $(a, \tau)$. Since they only hold values, there are no constraints between the rows.

A CTL copies all of the MemBefore values in the memory trace as reads, at timestamp $\tau = 0$.
Another CTL copies the final values from memory to MemAfter. For more details on which values are propagated, consult \ref{final-memory}.
