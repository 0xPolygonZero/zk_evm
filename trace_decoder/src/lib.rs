//! <div class="warning">
//! This library is undergoing major refactoring as part of (#275)(https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/zk_evm/issues/275).
//! Consider all TODOs to be tracked under that issue.
//! </div>
//!
//! Your neighborhood zk-ready [ethereum](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/erigon)
//! [node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon/) emits binary "witnesses"[^1].
//!
//! But [`plonky2`], your prover, wants [`GenerationInputs`].
//!
//! This library helps you get there.
//!
//! [^1]: A witness is an attestation of the state of the world, which can be
//!       proven by a prover.
//!
//! # Non-Goals
//! - Performance - this won't be the bottleneck in any proving system.
//! - Robustness - malicious or malformed input may crash this library.
//!
//! TODO(0xaatif): refactor all the docs below
//!
//! It might not be obvious why we need traces for each txn in order to generate
//! proofs. While it's true that we could just run all the txns of a block in an
//! EVM to generate the traces ourselves, there are a few major downsides:
//! - The client is likely a full node and already has to run the txns in an EVM
//!   anyways.
//! - We want this protocol to be as agnostic as possible to the underlying
//!   chain that we're generating proofs for, and running our own EVM would
//!   likely cause us to loose this genericness.
//!
//! While it's also true that we run our own zk-EVM (plonky2) to generate
//! proofs, it's critical that we are able to generate txn proofs in parallel.
//! Since generating proofs with plonky2 is very slow, this would force us to
//! sequentialize the entire proof generation process. So in the end, it's ideal
//! if we can get this information sent to us instead.
//!
//! This library generates an Intermediary Representation (IR) of
//! a block's transactions, given a [BlockTrace] and some additional
//! data represented by [OtherBlockData].
//!
//! It first preprocesses the [BlockTrace] to provide transaction,
//! withdrawals and tries data that can be directly used to generate an IR.
//! For each transaction, this library extracts the
//! necessary data from the processed transaction information to
//! return the IR.
//!
//! The IR is used to generate root proofs, then aggregation proofs and finally
//! block proofs. Because aggregation proofs require at least two entries, we
//! pad the vector of IRs thanks to additional dummy payload intermediary
//! representations whenever necessary.
//!
//! ### [Withdrawals](https://ethereum.org/staking/withdrawals) and Padding
//!
//! Withdrawals are all proven together in a dummy payload. A dummy payload
//! corresponds to the IR of a proof with no transaction. They must, however, be
//! proven last. The padding is therefore carried out as follows: If there are
//! no transactions in the block, we add two dummy transactions. The withdrawals
//! -- if any -- are added to the second dummy transaction. If there is only one
//! transaction in the block, we add one dummy transaction. If
//! there are withdrawals, the dummy transaction is at the end. Otherwise, it is
//! added at the start. If there are two or more transactions:
//! - if there are no withdrawals, no dummy transactions are added
//! - if there are withdrawals, one dummy transaction is added at the end, with
//!   all the withdrawals in it.

/// The broad overview is as follows:
///
/// 1. Ethereum nodes emit a bunch of binary [`wire::Instruction`]s, which are
///    parsed in [`wire`].
/// 2. They are passed to one of two "frontends", depending on the node
///    - [`hermez_cdk_erigon`], which contains an [`smt_trie`].
///    - [`zero_jerigon`], which contains an [`mpt_trie`].
/// 3. The frontend ([`hermez_cdk_erigon::Frontend`] or
///    [`zero_jerigon::Frontend`]) is passed to the "backend", which lowers to
///    [`evm_arithmetization::GenerationInputs`].
