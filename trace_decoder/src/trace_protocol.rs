//! The trace protocol for sending proof information to a prover scheduler.
//!
//! Because parsing performance has a very negligible impact on overall proof
//! generation latency & throughput, the overall priority of this protocol is
//! ease of implementation for clients. The flexibility comes from giving
//! multiple ways to the client to provide the data for the protocol, where the
//! implementors can pick whichever way is the most convenient for them.
//!
//! It might not be obvious why we need traces for each txn in order to generate
//! proofs. While it's true that we could just run all the txns of a block in an
//! EVM to generate the traces ourselves, there are a few major downsides:
//! - The client is likely a full node and already has to run the txns in an EVM
//!   anyways.
//! - We want this protocol to be as agnostic as possible to the underlying
//!   chain that we're generating proofs for, and running our own EVM would
//!   likely cause us to loose this genericness.
//!
//! While it's also true that we run our own zk-EVM (plonky2) to generate
//! proofs, it's critical that we are able to generate txn proofs in parallel.
//! Since generating proofs with plonky2 is very slow, this would force us to
//! sequentialize the entire proof generation process. So in the end, it's ideal
//! if we can get this information sent to us instead.
