/// Checks the consistency of circuits code by comparing a computed hash
/// derived from the provided array of circuit code hashes against a reference
/// hash stored in a designated file within the circuits folder. This function
/// performs several actions based on this comparison:
///
/// - If the computed aggregate hash differs from the stored hash, or if the
///   hash file does not exist, the function will delete the existing circuits
///   folder (if it exists), recreate it, and then write the new computed hash
///   into the hash file.
///
/// - If the computed hash matches the stored hash, indicating no changes in the
///   circuits code, the function takes no action.
///
/// This process ensures that the stored hash always reflects the current state
/// of the circuits code, providing a mechanism for detecting changes and
/// maintaining consistency.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `circuits_hashes` - A dynamic number of `Vec<u8>` arguments representing
///   circuit code hashes.
///
/// # Side Effects
///
/// - May delete and recreate the circuits folder.
/// - May modify or create a file within the circuits folder to store the latest
///   hash.
